# Mini Farm Game Case

---

## ðŸšœ Project Overview

**Mini Farm Case** is a modular Unity project designed with clean architecture principles and modern async programming techniques. The project leverages several powerful libraries and frameworks to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance.

---

## ðŸ§© Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Designed for easy expansion and maintainability, allowing you to add or modify features without disrupting existing systems.
- **Async/Await with UniTask**: Smooth and efficient asynchronous workflows using **Cysharp/UniTask**, providing better performance than Unity's default coroutines.
- **Reactive Programming with UniRx**: Handles data streams and events reactively, simplifying state management and UI updates.
- **Serialization with MemoryPack**: Fast and efficient binary serialization for saving/loading game data.
- **Dependency Injection with Extenject (Zenject)**: Manages dependencies cleanly, improving testability and reducing coupling.
- **Tweening with DoTween**: Easy and performant animation and transitions for UI and gameplay elements.
- **NuGet for Unity**: Simplifies package management by integrating NuGet packages directly into the Unity project.
